# Testing and Debugging Module


### Python and c++ IDE

For python coding, a text editor with grammar highlight + QtDesigner is enough to code in the first case. QtDesigner can be used to generate and edit Qt ui files. Spyder, which comes with Anaconda, is a good and lightweight Python IDE with debugger support.

Various c++ IDE are available to support Cmake project. Visual Studio 2015 is essential for development on Windows. Cmake project can be mapped to a VS solution (*.sln) with a bundle of projects corresponding to

Latest QtCreator works with Qt 4.x and Qt 5.x; it also support CMake project.

see tutorial of import cmakelists.txt as project file <http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-cmake.html>

1.    Select File > Open File or Project.
2.    Select the CMakeLists.txt file from your CMake project.
3.    Select out of source build folder, you may have already
4.    Run camke once to build up pcb database
5.    The whole FreeCAD source tree will be loaded into QtCreator
6.    Further configuration 'Projects > Build Settings > Edit build configuration'

![Load FreeCAD source tree to QtCreator](../images/QtCreator_as_FreeCAD_IDE.png)

QtCreator or similar IDE can provide:

- graphic git support
- code completion and API hint
- fast code navigation by 'goto definition'
- break point setup in debug
- CMakeLists.txt editor with grammar highlight and keyword completion, etc.

## Extra tools for module developer

- InkScape to generate SVG icon
Great vector drawing program. Adhers to the SVG standard and is used to draw Icons and Pictures. Get it at <https://www.inkscape.org>

- Doxygen to generate documentation
A very good and stable tool to generate source documentation from the .h and .cpp files.

- Gimp to edit XPM icon file
Not much to say about the Gnu Image Manipulation Program. Besides it can handle .xpm files which is a very convenient way to handle Icons in QT Programs. XPM is basically C-Code which can be compiled into a program. Get the GIMP here: <https://www.gimp.org>

- ccache to reduce Travis and local building time
7~10 faster building was reported by `ccache`, see FreeCAD thread [Developers - if you want must FASTER local builds, install GNU ccache](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=16481#p130322)

- cppcheck to improve coding quality


### ccache to accelerate compilation

`ccache` has been actively developed, see its official website <https://ccache.dev/>. It support only GCC and CLANG compilers.
Source code of `ccache` is hosted on github: <https://github.com/ccache/ccache>

Steps to use ccache:
1. install `ccache` from linux distribution's repository

2. configure your project
for a cmake project, add the following code into top level cmakelists.txt

```bash
# Configure CCache if available
find_program(CCACHE_FOUND ccache)
if(CCACHE_FOUND)
        set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE ccache)
        set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY RULE_LAUNCH_LINK ccache)
endif(CCACHE_FOUND)
```

3. rerun the `cmake` to use `ccache` in FreeCAD or your other projects.

## C++ debugging

### Build FreeCAD from source

First of all, make sure you can build the official source once done `git clone` which confirms you can install all the lib dependent.

compiler's warning is the first place to spot error and potential bugs.

### Reduce compiling time by ccache

#### Incremental compilation by ccache

#### Update *.ui file

#### Compile only one module


> after changing an ui-file like this one (https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob ... ces-ifc.ui) I have to run make clean && make to get the changes active.
>

In this case `cd` into the Arch directory first before running "make clean" because then it only rebuilds this module and not the whole project.


### Print debug info
Qt debug <http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/debug.html>

The console class This class manage all the stdio stuff.  here is the generated document for [src/Base/Console.h]

> This includes Messages, Warnings, Log entries and Errors. The incoming Messages are distributed with the FCConsoleObserver. The FCConsole class itself makes no IO, it's more like a manager. ConsoleSingleton is a singleton! That means you can access the only instance of the class from every where in c++ by simply using:

```cpp
  #include <Base/Console.h>
  //...
  Base::Console().Log("Stage: %d",i);
```

[src/Base/Tools.h]
```cpp
struct BaseExport Tools
{
    /**
     * @brief toStdString Convert a QString into a UTF-8 encoded std::string.
     * @param s String to convert.
     * @return A std::string encoded as UTF-8.
     */
    static inline std::string toStdString(const QString& s)
        { QByteArray tmp = s.toUtf8(); return std::string(tmp.constData(), tmp.size()); }

    /**
     * @brief fromStdString Convert a std::string encoded as UTF-8 into a QString.
     * @param s std::string, expected to be UTF-8 encoded.
     * @return String represented as a QString.
     */
    static inline QString fromStdString(const std::string & s)
        { return QString::fromUtf8(s.c_str(), s.size()); }
}
```

Example usage of QString from *std::string*, `#include <Base/Tools.h>`
`Base::Tools::fromStdString()`

### Tips for debugging cpp code

- compile only the module `/opt/FreeCAD/build/src/Mod/Fem$ make`
- show logging info:

`Edit` -> `Preferences` -> `output windows` -> `record log`


## Step-by-step debugging via gdb

Once I run into a *Segmentation fault (core dumped)* for "import vtk" in python console of FreeCAD and FreeCADCmd.
GDB might tell you more information, like which function, file object caused this fault.

<https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Continuing-and-Stepping.html>

**Example:**
```
gdb freecadcmd
gdb start
gdb continue
gdb where
```

### Generating a Backtrace

## Python debugging
See also https://wiki.freecad.org/Debugging#Python_Debugging
### Tips for developing in Python

- remember : modified python file will not take effect until FreeCAD is relauched

- always try to write a test function avoiding test in GUI mode

	Debugging functionality without GUI could be straightforwards, e.g.
	[src/Mod/Fem/TestFem.py],

For Gui functions, recarding all operation into Macro, and replay them can accelerate the testing.

- symbolic link to python files for quick test without installation after compiling for the mixed c++ and python coding

```bash
ln -s /opt/Cfd/FoamCaseBuilder  fc_build_dir/Mod/Cfd/FoamCaseBuilder
```

### Where is python's print message?

`print "Error Message"` does not work in FreeCAD, neither PythonConsole in GUI mode, or terminal starting freecad program (stdout can be viewed in ReportView, by activating this view). By changing the default preference, it is possible to show print message from python module.

![changing the default preference to show print message](../images/preference_redirectPyhtonOutput.png)

- Method 1: FreeCAD.Console.PrintMessage() for show up
- Method 2: Print to TextEdit widget in your specific TaskPanel  class


[src/Gui/GuiConsole.h]
```
/** The console window class  This class opens a console window when instantiated  and redirect the stdio streams to it as long it exists.
 *  After instantiation it automatically register itself at the FCConsole class and gets all the FCConsoleObserver messages. The class must not used directly! Only the ??? over the FCConsole class is allowed!
 */
```

### Reload an edited python file in FreeCAD GUI

[Discussion on reload python code without restart FreeCAD](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12666)

```python
>>> import FemTools
>>> FemTools.FemTools.known_analysis_types
['static', 'frequency']
---- Here I added one more analysis type to known_analysis_type in FemTools.py file -----
>>> reload(FemTools)
<module 'FemTools' from '/home/przemo/software/FreeCAD/build/Mod/Fem/FemTools.py'>
>>> FemTools.FemTools.known_analysis_types
['static', 'frequency', 'mock']
```


This section is an excerpt from [*Sri Sanketh Uppalapati* article on GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reloading-modules-python/)

>`reload()` reloads a previously imported module. This is useful if you have edited the module source file using an external editor and want to try out the new version without leaving the Python interpreter. The return value is the module object.  Note: The argument should be a module which has been successfully imported.

```python
#For Python2.x
reload(module)

#For above 2.x and <=Python3.3, which is not common in 2019

import imp
imp.reload(module)

#For >=Python3.4

import importlib
importlib.reload(module)
```

### Test FreeCAD GUI function by python script

We already know that non-GUI code of FreeCAD can be tested without starting GUI, however, the GUI is still needed for testing. It is possible to test GUI code by script, see an [example of CFD workbench test script](). It can save time to utilize the GUI. Potentially, a `git hook` can be set to run this script for each commit. This is useful since a third-party UnitTest script will not be run by FreeCAD Test workbench.

```python
# run a gui test for FreeCAD GUI functions

import sys
sys.path.append('/usr/lib/freecad-daily/lib')

import FreeCAD as App
import FreeCADGui as Gui

Gui.showMainWindow()
Gui.activateWorkbench("StartWorkbench")

##########################################################
App.newDocument("Unnamed")
App.setActiveDocument("Unnamed")
App.ActiveDocument=App.getDocument("Unnamed")
Gui.ActiveDocument=Gui.getDocument("Unnamed")
Gui.activateWorkbench("PartWorkbench")
App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Cylinder","Cylinder")
App.ActiveDocument.ActiveObject.Label = "Cylinder"
App.ActiveDocument.recompute()
Gui.SendMsgToActiveView("ViewFit")

Gui.activateWorkbench("CfdWorkbench")
Gui.ActiveDocument.setEdit('Cylinder',0)

import FemGui
import CfdObjects
CfdObjects.makeCfdAnalysis('CfdAnalysis')
FemGui.setActiveAnalysis(App.activeDocument().ActiveObject)
FemGui.getActiveAnalysis().addObject(CfdObjects.makeCfdSolver('OpenFOAM'))
FemGui.getActiveAnalysis().addObject(CfdObjects.makeCfdFluidMaterial('FluidMaterial'))
mesh_obj = CfdObjects.makeCfdMeshGmsh('Cylinder_Mesh')
mesh_obj.Part = App.ActiveDocument.Cylinder
FemGui.getActiveAnalysis().addObject(mesh_obj)

# more code copied from interpreter widget, whatever recorded by macro recording

##########################################################
Gui.getMainWindow().close()
#Gui.doCommand('exit()')  # another way to exit

```


### Testing FreeCAD Python GUI and CLI via AppImage
The AppImage technology allows to construct and distribute a cross Linux distro executable.
It also has the ability to be utilized as a testing tool for python code.

#### Background
As mentioned above, a very convenient aspect of FreeCAD is that a majority of it
is built in python and doesn't require to manually compile the code (like c++).
Essentially, a python file can be modified and upon reloading the python script (or restarting FreeCAD)
those changes will be integrated. A developer can quickly work on the latest FreeCAD
release using this technique and an appimage. FYI, the following procedure doesn't
modify the environment in any way, in other words, nothing gets installed and no
environment paths get modified. All one needs to do is the following:

#### Modifying AppImages
```bash
<FreeCAD>.AppImage --appimage-extract # Decompresses the AppImage
cd squashfs-root/                     # cd in to the expanded AppImage tree
# (Open your python file(s) in you favorite code editor, modify, and save)
./AppRun                              # Run FreeCAD AppImage in it's current state
```

#### Repackaging AppImages
If you've done the above and now want to re-package the AppImage with your latest
changes (useful for several reasons though mainly for having others quickly test
your modifications) proceed as follows:
```bash
cd ..                                   # Make sure we're out of squashfs-root/
wget "https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/releases/download/continuous/appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage"
chmod a+x appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage 
./appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage squashfs-root
```
> * `wget` is a utility to download remote files
> * `chmod` will give the `appimagetool` executable privileges
> * `appimagetool` is an AppImage utility that converts an AppDir into a self-mounting filesystem image.  
> * `appimagetool` will repackage the AppImage and compress it making it ready for distribution
