## Why I want to write this book

- Learn the software architecture of FreeCAD: a large open source project
- Learn to use git to contribute to open source projects like FreeCAD
- Save time for new developers to explore the source code of FreeCAD
- Record personal note and lesson during writing/contributing code to FreeCAD
- Some chapters of this ebook is seeking to be merged into official wiki after reviewed as usable

My research: ["Automated and Intelligent Engineering Design"](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Automated-and-Intelligent-Enigneering-Design)

## How to contribute to this ebook

- write on unfinished topics/chapters listed in [todo.md](./todo.md)
  fork and pull request `git clone https://github.com/qingfengxia/FreeCAD_Mod_Dev_Guide.git`

- file bug for outdated code analysis
  As this book is about code analysis while FreeCAD is under heavy development, source codes quoted may outdated quickly.
  Please point out my report bugs in [ this github issues board](https://github.com/qingfengxia/FreeCAD_Mod_Dev_Guide/issues)
  
- This ebook is pre-processed by a python script, see more details in the [scripts](https://github.com/qingfengxia/FreeCAD_Mod_Dev_Guide/tree/master/scripts) folder's Readme.

  There are some anchor texts like:

  -  [src/*.h/cpp] are processed into link to the latest official FreeCAD source.
  - some another anchors "## folders ... ", which will be marked out soon more explicitly
